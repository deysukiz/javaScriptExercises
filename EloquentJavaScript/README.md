# Eloquent JavaScript Exercises 

## What can you find here?

Here I'm adding the exercises I'm resolving of the Eloquent JavaScript book, the exercises are organized by chapter.

Currently, I'm part of the _TerranigmArk's Coding Book Club_, where we are reading [Eloquent JavaScript Book](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html). Each saturday we reunite to talk about the book and share our achievements and doubts of the book.

> It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are struggling to follow the book, do not jump to any conclusions about your own capabilities. You are fineâ€”you just need to keep at it. Take a break, reread some material, and make sure you read and understand the example programs and exercises. Learning is hard work, but everything you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier.
